      <h3><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Boil beef with 2tsp bouillon powder, ½ tsp salt and chopped onion,
          oregano and boil till tender. This should take between 20 minutes or
          longer depending on the cut of meat used. Tougher meat would take
          longer to cook. Take the beef out of the stock, sieve the stock to get
          rid of scum and reserve for later.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place a saucepan on medium heat, add vegetable oil and heat till hot,
          carefully drop the meat into the hot oil and fry until golden brown.
          You may choose to grill the meat for healthier option.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the fried beef on a kitchen towel and move on to cooking the
          stew.
        </li>
        <li>
          To the hot oil, carefully add the pepper mix, stir to combine, cover
          the pan with a lid and cook for 10 minutes. Stir to combine, if the
          stew is becoming thick, add beef stock or water to avoid burning.
          (Remember this is fried stew so you only need to add little
          water/stock at a time if using at all).
        </li>
        <li>
          Add curry and thyme or any other spices you choose to add and stir to
          combine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add bouillon powder or salt (you can use the combination of both but
          be careful, so you don’t overdo it. Remember you have added salt and
          bouillon to boil the beef. Also, if you have added the beef stock to
          the stew, you might not need to add salt or bouillon powder).
        </li>
        <li>
          Return the fried beef to the stew, stir until well combined and
          continue to simmer for another 10 to 15 minutes or until oil floats on
          top of the stew. Turn off the heat and serve stew.
        </li>
      </ol>
